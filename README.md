### [Live Demo](https://mannylerma.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-v2/)

## Overview
My [original project](https://mannylerma.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/) for this game was created for the curriculum of The Odin Project, however after I learned more capabilites I decided to recreate this project. I wanted to create a playful vision with the redesign. With this new version I wanted to practice more on JavaScript, animation, and design.

## How To Play
Choose your selection by clicking one of the featured characters. This will play one round. Simultaneously, the computer will randomly select their character and generate a move. Whoever wins the round gets a point. The first to five points wins the match. 

## Built With

### Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

### Tools
* VsCode
* Git/GitHub
* ProCreate
* Adobe Illustrator

## Development Process
1. This is practically a redesign of an existing project that I had done prior for the curriculum of The Odin Project. However, I cleaned up the code only the kept the necessary.\

Original Design:\

2. After laying out the functionality of the game, I started designing the interface along with the characters, animations, UI, etc.\

3. After deciding on the style/aesthetics, I worked on the final design of the project. I used ProCreate and Adobe Illustrator to bring the characters and environment to life.\

4. I compiled everything together to create a boxing fight match between Rock, Paper, and Scissors for tonight's main event.

## Summary
